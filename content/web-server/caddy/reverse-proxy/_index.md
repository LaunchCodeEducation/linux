## Configuring Caddy as a Reverse Proxy

A common task performed by a web server is to **proxy HTTP requests** to a running application server.

If you have completed an LC101 style course you predominately wrote code running in an application server. 

Examples of application server frameworks:

- Springboot (Java)
- Entity (C#)
- Express.js (Node)
- Flask (Python)
- Django (Python)
- Rails (Ruby)
- Cake (PHP)
- 1 million additional options for every single programming language under the sun

The application server frameworks contain code that handle raw HTTP requests, perform certain actions, and serve an HTTP response.

A production grade web server must proxy HTTP requests to the application server framework.

In this case a web user makes an HTTP request to a server. Caddy catches the initial HTTP request and passes it to a running application server. The application server processes the HTTP request and builds an appropriate HTTP response. The application server then passes the HTTP response back to Caddy who sends it back to the web user.

This may seem like a complicated process. However, application servers are not built as **production grade** web servers and lack many of the features that web servers like Caddy provide. Caddy and other production grade web servers allow for multiple workers to handle requests, can distribute high web load to many different locations, can provide TLS via SSL termination, are optimized to handle a high volume of HTTP requests, and more.

In this article you will be running a Springboot application framework, and configuring Caddy to serve as a reverse proxy to the application framework.

## Remove Previously Created `Caddyfile`

```bash
rm /home/student/Caddyfile
```

## Create New `Caddyfile`

```bash
touch /home/student/Caddyfile
```
## Add Configuration to New `Caddyfile`

```caddy
http://localhost {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
```

## Clone Build Artifacts

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LaunchCodeTechnicalTraining/spring-techjobs-mvc-artifact
```

## Install Runtime Dependency

{{% notice note %}}
You may already have the necessary Java Runtime Environment to run this project `openjdk-11-jre`.
{{% /notice %}}

If you do not have this installed on your system you can install it with:
```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre
```

## Run Application Server

In a new terminal run:

```bash
java -jar /home/student/spring-techjobs-mvc-artifact/spring-mvc.jar
```

## Reload Caddy

```bash
caddy reload
```

## Access via Web Browser

## Curl Localhost

![curl-validation](pictures/curl-validation.png?classes=border)

```bash
curl localhost
```
