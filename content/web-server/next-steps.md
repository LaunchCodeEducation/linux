## Next Steps

### Web Servers

- NGINX
- caddy
- apache
  - and apache tomcat -> Specifically for Java web apps (comes as a part of springboot)
- gunicorn -> WSGI Python HTTP Server for UNIX
- haproxy -> I think it's more about reverse proxying and load balancing

### Additional Concepts

- load balancing
- web server logs
- web server monitoring
