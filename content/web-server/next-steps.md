We learned a lot about web servers:

- Installing
- Controlling with `systemctl`
- **Configuring as a static web server**
- **Configuring as a reverse proxy to an application server**

We did all of this for two different web servers: `NGINX` and `Caddy`.

There are many more web servers, and there are additional things you can do with web servers.

## Resources

A great place to learn more would be to read through the documentation for both of the web servers introduced in this class.

- **General Documentation**
  - [Caddy Documentation Homepage](https://caddyserver.com/docs/)
  - [NGINX Documentation Homepage](https://nginx.org/en/docs/)

Additionally the next three concepts related to web servers we recommend you to start researching are:

- **Load Balancing**
  - [Caddy Documentation: Load Balancing](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/reverse_proxy#load-balancing)
  - [NGINX Documentation: Load Balancing](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/load_balancing.html)
- **Enabling HTTPS**
  - [Caddy Documentation: HTTPS](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#automatic-https)
  - [NGINX Documentation: HTTPS](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html)
- **Web Server Logging**
  - [Caddy Documentation: Logging](https://caddyserver.com/docs/logging)
  - [NGINX Documentation: Logging](https://nginx.org/en/docs/syslog.html)
