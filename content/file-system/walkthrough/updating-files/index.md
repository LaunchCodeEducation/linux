## Update Files and Directories

You can update the contents of a file/directory or the metadata (name, last modified, permissions) of a file/directory.

## Updating Metadata

### Moving Files and Directories

The filename and path of a file/directory is a key piece of metadata. In many instances it makes sense to move a file, or directory to a new location within the file-system. You can move a file/directory with the `mv` command.

Let's create a new directory `temp-dir` and a new file `temp.file` both in our home directory.

![mkdir ~/temp-dir && touch ~/temp.file](pictures/mkdir-and-touch.png?classes=border)

Now we have `/home/student/temp-dir/` and `/home/student/temp.file`. Let's move `temp.file` into our new directory `temp-dir/`.

`mv` requires **two** arguments. The first argument is the file/directory we want to move. The second argument is the directory that will hold the file/directory we want to move.

So to move the `temp.file` into the `temp-dir` we would need a command like: `mv ~/temp.file ~/temp-dir/`

![mv ~/temp.file temp-dir](pictures/mv-temp-file-temp-dir.png?classes=border)

You can use absolute or relative paths with the `mv` command. So you could have accomplished the same task with absolute paths:
![mv absolute paths](pictures/mv-absolute-paths.png?classes=border)
Or you could have accomplished the same task with relative paths:
![mv relative paths](pictures/mv-relative-paths.png?classes=border)

#### Moving Directories

The `mv` command works with directories as well. Let's move the `~/temp-dir` directory into the `~/Documents` directory. Our first argument will be `temp.dir` as it represents the file/directory we want to move. The second argument will be `Documents` as it represents the directory we want to move our contents into.

`mv ~/temp-dir/ ~/Documents`

![mv ~/temp-dir ~/Documents](pictures/mv-temp-dir-documents.png?classes=border)

### Moving to Rename Files and Directories

When you use the `mv` command you are affecting metadata by updating the absolute path of the file/directory. The previous section focused on changing the directories that hold a file/directory. However, with the `mv` command you can also change the **name** of a file/directory.

Let's change the name, but not location, of a file. Currently we have a file: `/home/student/Documents/temp-dir/temp.file` what if we wanted to change the name of that file to `roster.txt`?

We can use the `mv` command to update the absolute path. The parent directories will stay the same, but we will simply provide it a **new** filename.

`mv ~/Documents/temp-dir/temp.file ~/Documents/temp-dir/roster.txt`

![mv ~/Documents/temp-dir/temp.file ~/Documents/temp-dir/roster.txt](pictures/mv-to-rename-in-place.png?classes=border)

This command **updated** the name of the file without changing it's location. Under the hood, the absolute path of the file was updated and that's the purpose of the `mv` command. The absolute path started as `/home/student/Document/temp-dir/temp.file` and we updated it to `/home/student/Document/temp-dir/roster.txt`!

You can both update the location and the name of a file in one `mv` command.
![move and rename](pictures/mv-and-rename.png?classes=border)
This command moved the `roster.txt` file from the `temp-dir/` directory into the current working directory (as represented by `./`) and renamed it to `hello.txt`. That's a lot of work packed into one command!

## Updating File Contents

While changing the metadata attached to a file is important, it's not as common as updating the contents of a file. This section will focus on updating the internal contents of a file with the GNU bash shell terminal editor called `nano`.

Opening a file using a terminal text editor:

- `nano filename`
  - `vim filename`
  - `emacs filename`

{{% notice green "Bonus" "rocket" %}}
`echo "newline" >> filename`
{{% /notice %}}


Open the file in your favorite text editor or IDE. Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, Pycharm, Atom, etc.

## Using `nano`

GNU's `nano` stands for **N**ano's **ANO**ther editor. There is a very long history of terminal based text editors, they far outdate the graphical text editors you are familiar with. 

{{% notice note %}}
If you find any pair of computer enthusiasts that worked on computers between 1960-1990 they will likely have strong, but different, opinions on their favorite terminal text editor! These strong opinions still exist in many internet communities. You may have heard of the zealous arguments between `vim` and `emacs` users. `nano`, `vim`, and `emacs` are just three of the many dozens of terminal text editors that exist.
{{% /notice %}}

`nano` is a great choice as it is the most straightforward to use and it comes as a part of the standard package of most Linux/GNU distributions. We will predominately use `nano` to edit files in this course. We will also explore some of the basics of `vim`.

### Opening a File

Opening a file with `nano` is very straightforward. We simply execute the `nano` command with one argument, the file we wish to open. If the file exists, its contents will be populated into `nano`. If the file does not exist, it will be created as an empty file and opened within `nano`.

When you open the file you will leave the Bash shell behind and the `nano` text editor will take up the entirety of your terminal window.

Let's create and open a new file in our home directory called `myname.txt`.

`nano ~/myname.txt`

![nano ~/myname.txt](pictures/nano-myname.png?classes=border)

After executing the command you will see the `~/myname.txt` file opened in the `nano` text editor:

![nano text editor](pictures/nano-text-editor.png?classes=border)

There are three sections of the `nano` text editor:

- The top of the screen shows the version (`GNU nano 4.8`) and the currently opened file (`/home/student/myname.txt`)
- A large block of space, with a cursor. This is the area where we can create, read, update, and delete any of the contents of the file.
- The bottom of the screen contains a useful collection of **control** keys allowing us to save, exit, or assist us in editing the file. 

#### Add Contents to the File

Go ahead and type your name into the file:

![nano add name](pictures/nano-add-name.png?classes=border)

I simply typed directly on my keyboard and nano added the contents to the file! You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate the file.

### Write File

Once you are happy with the changes you have made to the file, we need to write the changes to the hard disk.

`nano` provides a **control** key combo for writing files. By simply holding the control (`ctrl`) and then pressing the `o` key `nano` will `Write Out` the file.

Give it a shot.

![nano write out](pictures/nano-write-out.png?classes=border)

Notice the change to the `nano` window. A new message towards the bottom of the screen (above the control key combos) is confirming the name and location of the file to be written.

The `/home/student/myname.txt` file didn't exist before we opened the file. It is standard behavior for `nano` to ask us to confirm before creating and writing the contents of the file.

You can simply hit enter on your keyboard to write the `/home/student/myname.txt` file with the contents you provided in the window. Try it out.

![nano write confirm](pictures/nano-write-confirm.png?classes=border)

`nano` was kind enough to confirm that one line was written, as indicated by the message above the control key combos.

### Exit File

To exit a file you simply need to invoke the control combo key for the Exit option. You should be able to see from the avaible options that it is `ctrl` + `x`.

Try it out.

![nano exit](pictures/nano-exit.png?classes=border)

Since the file had been written in the previous step, and had no changes nano immediately exited the file and returned us to our Bash shell. 

{{% notice note %}}
If you invoke the exit condition of `nano` while having unsaved changes, it will prompt to write, or discard the changes before exiting to the Bash shell.

#### Looking at the New File

Let's see the new file. Enter `ls ~` to see the new `myname.txt`.

![ls ~](pictures/ls-for-myname.png?classes=border)

And let's `cat` out the contents of our file:

![cat ~/myname.txt](pictures/cat-myname.png?classes=border)

We have successfully opened a file, edited the contents of a file, wrote a file, and displayed the contents of a file all from our terminal!

Like everything in this class, you will become more comfortable the more you practice. If you truly want to become comfortable and productive with a terminal text editor you need to **use one often**. `nano` is straightforward to use, but lacks the many features you will find in `vim` or `emacs`. For now practice creating and editing some files with `nano`. Soon we will learn about installing new software and you can take it upon yourself to learn how to use either `vim` or `emacs`. Conquering the basics and being comfortable with some of their more advanced uses will benefit you greatly if you work with Linux systems in your career.
