## Major Concepts & Key Terminology

For our final project we will be creating (and executing) 2 Bash scripts:

### Script One

A machine setup, and initialization script.

This script will automatically do everything that we learned in the Web Server: Static and Web Server: Reverse Proxy chapters.

It will all need to exist in one script. You will prove it works, by spinning up a brand new virtualbox image. Cloning the script. Executing the script. Access your deployed application from the browser of your VirtualBox image.

### Script Two:

This script fires every 5 minutes. It is constantly *polling* the project remote repo. If changes are detected it redeploys the application!
