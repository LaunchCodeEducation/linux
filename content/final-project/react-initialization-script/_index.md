## Get Organized

What needs to happen for the React project to be deployed?

### VirtualBox

1. VirtualBox Image created
1. VirtualBox First time setup completed

### Machine State

1. `git` must be installed
1. web server must be installed

### Project Artifacts

The artifacts are already built, they just need to be installed onto the machine with `git`.

1. use `git` to clone build artifacts

{{% /notice %}}

### Web Server Configuration

`caddy` or `nginx` must be configured to catch HTTP requests and respond as a `file_server`, and then must be reloaded.

At this point the `react` project should be accessible in your browser.
