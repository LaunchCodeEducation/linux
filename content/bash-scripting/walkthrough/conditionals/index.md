## Conditional Statements in Bash

Similar to Java, JavaScript and Python you are also able to write conditional statements in bash:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Bash" %}}
```Bash
if [[ condition ]]
then 
    if clause statement
else
    else clause
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="python" %}}
```python
if condition:
    if clause statement
else condtion:
    else clause
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="JavaScript" %}}
```js
if (condition) {
    clause statement
}
else (else condtion) {
    else clause statement
}
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Java" %}}
```java
if (condition) {
    clause statement
}
else (else condtion) {
    else clause statement
}
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}
