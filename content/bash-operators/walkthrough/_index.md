## Walkthrough

Bahs and most Linux shells use three different Input / Output streams:
- `stdin`: Standard Input
- `stdout`: Standard Output
- `stderr`: Standard Error

{{% notice note %}}
By default all forms of stdin and stderr are printed within your terminal window
{{% /notice %}}

{{% children %}}
