## Next Steps

Linux follows the philosophy of `everything is a file`.

A fantastic resource to learn more about Linux files and the filesystem is [The Linux Documentation Project: Chapter 3. About files and the file system](https://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/chap_03.html). This resource goes much deeper than this course on explaining the Linux File System.

Additionally read the `man` pages for both `chown` and `chmod`.

```bash
man chown
```

```bash
man chmod
```
