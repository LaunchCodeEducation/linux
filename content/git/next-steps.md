Going to the source is the best way to learn a tool. The `git` official website and GitHub repositories:

- [Git Homepage](https://git-scm.com)
- [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Git GitHub Repos](https://github.com/git)

In addition the Atlassian resources for learning `git` are fantastic:

- [Atlassian: Learn Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud)
- [Atlassian: Beginner](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
- [Atlassian: Getting Started](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository)
