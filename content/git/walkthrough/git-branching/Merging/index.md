## Merge Strategies

In this walkthrough you will find two different merge strategies. `git merge` and `git rebase`. The main benefits of `git merge` is that you will keep the original history of the `master` branch in tact. `git rebase` will alter the history but you are able to perform the rebase on a alternate branch. `get merge` requires you to merge a branch directly into master. `git rebase` allows you to rebase your development branch on top of master.
