## Branching

Branches allow users to work on projects under version control in a safe and controllable way. Rather than changing folders and files on your `master` branch where you have a working project, branching allows you to add new features and bug fixes on a branch to then later merge them with your master branch. This ensures that you do not break or add unitended bugs directly to your master or main branch of development.

In the Git Branches walkthrough you will be doing the following:
- Creating new branches with `git branch`
- Changing branches with `git checkout`
- Fixing an existing bug
  - staging changes with `git add` and `git commit`
- Push changes to remote repository using `git push`
