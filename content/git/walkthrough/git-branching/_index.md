## Branching

<!-- Branches allow users to work on projects under version control in a safe and controllable way. you to add new features and bug fixes on a branch to then later merge them with your master branch. -->
Working with branches allows you to diverge from the master branch of development. 

Working on a branch seperate from the master branch provides many benefits. One of which is to create, read, update, and delete content without breaking anything on the master branch.

In the Git Branches walkthrough you will be doing the following:
- Creating new branches with `git branch`
- Changing branches with `git checkout`
- Fixing existing bugs
  - staging changes with `git add` and `git commit`
- Pushing changes to remote repositories with `git push`
