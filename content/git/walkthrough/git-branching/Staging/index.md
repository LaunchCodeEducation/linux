## Staging

This would be a great place to stage your changes for a commit and submit a pull request within your own remote repo for additional practice. Run the `git status` command to view the changes made to the project.

- Add the changes
- Commit the changes
- Push updated local branch to remote repo
- Submit a pull request and merge the `bug-fix` branch into the `master` branch.

 - Update master when creating new branches
- Viewing current local branch and existing remote branches
  - `git branch`, `git branch -a`
- Creating a new branch
  - `git branch [new-branch]`
- Checkout to different branch
  - `git checkout [new-branch]`
