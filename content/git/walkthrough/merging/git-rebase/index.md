## Merging with Git Rebase

Rebase is another way to merge branches. The `git rebase` command will reapply commits from the current branch on top of the target branch.

To perform a `git rebase` the command is as follows: 

`git rebase [target-branch]`

{{% notice note %}}
You are rebasing the current branch on top of the `[target-branch]`.

## Repository Staged for Rebase

- Fork this repository: `https://github.com/LaunchCodeTechnicalTraining/py-demo-web-logs-rebase` to your personal github account
- Clone the forked repo to your own machine: `git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/py-demo-web-logs-rebase`
- `cd` into the root folder of the project inside of your terminal

## Perform the Rebase

This project is currently staged for a `git rebase`. There has been a feature branch merged into the `master` branch already. In order to merge the remaining branch `new-function` into `master` we will need to resolve the merge conflicts within the `main.py` and `.gitignore` files.

Checkout to the `new-function` branch and perform the `git rebase`:

![git-rebase-master-new-function](pictures/git-rebase-master-new-function.png?classes=border)

Run the following commands:
- `git checkout new-function`
- `git rebase master`

Rebase works by taking the original full history of the `[target-branch]` (in this case `master`) and builds each of the commits from the current working branch (in this case `new-function`) one at a time, adding to the history of the `[target-branch]`.

{{% notice green "Bonus" "rocket" %}}
During rebase conflicts can come up at any point in time between the first commit and the last commit of the current working branch as the commits are being built in order.
{{% /notice %}}

## Merge Conflicts

You will receive a notification that there are merge conflicts in `main.py` and `.gitignore` and that the conflicts need to be resolved manually before continuing the rebase onto the `master` branch.

The output looked similar to:

```bash
Auto-merging main.py
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in main.py
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in .gitingore
Auto-merging .gitignore
error: Failed to merge in the changes.
Resolve all conflictrs manually, mark them as resolved with
"git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue"
```

The output is telling us:

- Two Conflicts were detected in this commit: in `main.py` and in `.gitignore`
- It asks you to resolve the conflicts manually and mark them as resolved with the `git add` or `git rm` command
- After the conflicts have been resolved you can then run `git rebase --continue`. 

Let's resolve the conflicts so you can continue the rebase.

### Resolve Conflicts

- Open up the `main.py` file with vim:

![vim-web-logs](pictures/vim-main-py.png?classes=border)

Run the command `vim main.py`.

### Git Conflict Syntax

`Git` is simply a tool. It cannot make decisions. When a conflict emerges `git` will inform you about the conflict, but leaves it up to you to resolve the conflict.

Let's take a look at the syntax `git` uses to inform us of conflicts:

```python
<<<<<<< HEAD
    with open("web.log", "w") as tf:
      tf.write("{}: {}@{} ip: {} home-dir: {}".format(ts, user, hostname, local_ip, home_dir))
=======
    with open(new_file_name, "w") as the_file:
      the_file.write("{}: {}@{} ip: {} home-dir: {}\n".format(ts, user, hostname, local_ip, home_dir))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    new_function("web-log.txt")
>>>>>>> new feature
```

`Git` needs to tell us where the conflict happens, and the two possible options:

- Option one is marked as `<<<<<<< HEAD` indicating the conflicting section of the target branch (in this case `master`)
- Option two is marked as `>>>>>>> new feature` indicating the conflicting section of the current working branch (in this case `new feature` which we are currently rebasing onto the target branch)
- They are delineated by seven equal signs (`=======`)

This conflict syntax is always used to show merge conflicts.

{{% notice green "Bonus" "rocket" %}}
Since `git` uses a consistent syntax to highlight merge conflicts many IDEs have built in functionality to find the unique syntax to further highlight the conflicts and provide you with options for choosing one or the other, or both. Following is the default behavior of Visual Studio Code when a `git` conflict has been detected:

![Visual Studio Code git conflict highlight](pictures/vsc-git-conflict.png?classes=border)

Notice VSC is adding in some colors, clarifying information about current change and incoming change, and provides buttons to assist with handling the conflict in the form of:

- `Accept Current Change`
- `Accept Incoming Change`
- `Accept Both Changes`
- `Compare Changes`

Options that will help the user decide which block of code they want to keep.
{{% /notice %}}

In the case of this example we will be aspects from both changes and will need to manually enter in our code and clear out any `git` conflict syntax (the `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `>>>>>>> new feature`,  and `=======`).

### Manually Resolving Conflict in `main.py`

Paul and John both made changes to the main.py file. We need to decide which ones we want to keep and which to throw away. 

The changes that we want to keep in this walkthrough include the following:
- function created in John's solution
- name of file used in Paul's solution (`web.log`)

![edited-vim-changes](pictures/edited-vim-changes.png?classes=border)

After making the required changes to the file it should look similar to the above image. 
- Write the changes and exit vim.

{{% notice warning %}}
Make sure to write the changes to the file before exiting vim!
{{% /notice %}}

Now that the conflicts have been resolved inside of the `main.py` file you need to resolve the conflicts inside of the `.gitignore` file.

### Manually Resolving the Conflict in `.gitignore`

Open the `.gitignore` file with vim.

![vim-gitignore](pictures/vim-gitignore.png?classes=border)

Knowing that `web.log` is the name of the file preferred you can remove everything else from the `.gitignore` file so that there are no conflicts.

![fixed-gitignore](pictures/fixed-gitignore.png?classes=border)

Write the file and exit vim so that you are back inside of the `py-web-logs-continued` directory.

## Staging

All conflicts have been resolved you will need to add the changes to staging so that you can continue the rebase onto `master`.

![git-status-rebase](pictures/git-status-rebase.png?classes=border)

Run the following commands:
- `git status`: check changes made
- `git add .`: add changes to staging

{{% notice green "Bonus" "rocket" %}}
If you run the command `git status` after adding the changes to staging you will notice that it says "all conflicts fixed: run "`git rebase --continue`".
![git-status-fixed](pictures/git-status-fixed.png?classes=border)
{{% /notice %}}

## `Git Rebase --Continue`

Since you have added the changes to staging you can now continue the `git rebase`.

![git-rebase-continue](pictures/git-rebase-continue.png?classes=border)

Run the command `git rebase --continue`.

This tells `git` to continue the rebase by building additional commits from the current branch on top of the target branch. It will build any remaining commits and inform you of any detected `git conflicts`. After all of the commits have been successfully built and any conflicts have been resolved the rebase will complete.

{{% notice note %}}
In this example there will be no additional conflicts so `rebase` should complete after running `git rebase --continue`.
{{% /notice %}}

## Pushing Local Changes to Remote Branch

You have completed a `git rebase`. If you run the command `git status` you will receive a notice that your branch and `origin/new-function` have diverged. This is because you rebased your local `new-function` branch onto the local `master` branch. `Git` is smart enough to detect that your local repository's current working branches history has diverged from the remote repository's branch of the same name. This is a good thing, this is what we were attending to accomplish with the rebase!

![git-status-diverged](pictures/git-status-diverged.png?classes=border)

If you attempt to run the command `git push origin new-function` without force the push will be denied because the divergence in histories between your local and remote branches. Again `git` is detecting an issue and needs us to tell it which history we want it to keep. We can tell `git` to keep the history of the remote branch (`pull`), or the history of our local branch (`push`). In either case we will need to use the `--force` option to overwrite our local or the remote branch's history.

![git-push-force](pictures/git-push-force.png?classes=border)

Run the command `git push -f origin new-function`.

<!-- TODO: notes on the above line for further explanation -->

Now that the local changes have been pushed to the remote repository you should be able to merge the branch without conflict.

Open up the pull request from the `new-function` branch on your personal github account and merge the pull request!

{{% notice warning %}}
You may need to change the base repository and base branch reference!
{{% /notice %}}

- Click the `Create pull request` button.
- Click the `Merge pull request` button.
- Click the `Confirm merge` button.
- Click the `Delete branch` button.

You have successfully completed a `git rebase`!

## Recap:
- Checkout to branch needing to be merged
  - Rebase the branch onto master with `git rebase master`
  - Resolve merge conflicts
  - Add changes to staging
  - Continue rebase with `git rebase --continue`
