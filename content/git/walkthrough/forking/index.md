## Forking a Repository

A fork is simply a copy of a pre-existing repository. The major benefit of working with a forked repo is that any changes you make wont directly affect the original repository you forked. You are free to make changes to files and directories and push those changes to your forked repo. This can be very useful for your own experimentation or ideas you have that you want to add to a pre-existing project.

You can still submit a pull request to the original project repository you forked from your newly forked repo. Once you have made changes (preferably on a new branch: not master) you can submit that pull request through your github repo homepage. This is one way to contribute to a project as as an outside user.

To fork a repository you must visit the desired github project url and click on the `fork` button.

Click the `fork` button. This will be the repository you use in the remainder of the git chapter walkthroughs for the branching, and merging sections.
