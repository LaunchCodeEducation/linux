In this article we will be using the Repository we forked in the previous walkthrough article.

## Git Clone

Cloning a repo will work for any repository on GitHub you are authenticated to view. An original project, a forked project, or a project you have created previously that you would like to access on a new machine. 

The command used to accomplish this task is `git clone`. 

The main purpose of cloning a repository is to setup a local repository that is an exact copy of a remote repository. This allows you to make changes and commits locally. You can always sync your local and remote repositories (`git push` & `git pull`).

There are a few ways to clone a repository. The simplest way is to grab the github project url and run the `git clone` command inside of your terminal.

### Copy Github Project URL

Locate GitHub URL from your repository by hitting the green `Code` button and copying the link to your clipboard.

Now open up a new terminal and navigate to the directory where you want the project to live. In the below example you will see that we are cloning the project into the `Desktop` directory.

make sure to replace `/[your-github-user]/` with your own personal github username while also inside the directory where you want the project to live.

Run the command `git clone https://github.com/[your-github-user]/py-demo-web-logs.git` in the terminal.

This will create a new directory (inside of your current working directory) named `py-demo-web-logs`, initialize a local git repository (located in the `.git` directory) and copy all of the tracked files.

If you run the `ls` command you can see that the folder has been cloned:

You can also clone a repository and provide it a new name should you ever wish to do so. You can accomplish this by adding the name you want the directory to be called at the end of the command: `git clone https://github.com/[your-github-user]/py-demo-web-logs.git <newdirectoryname>`

### Explore Cloned Local Files

Now that you have cloned a repository onto your machine you can access the files locally. Take a look at what the `py-demo-web-logs` contains.

Navigate into the newly cloned directory and run the `ls` command. 

![ls-py-demo-web-logs](pictures/ls-py-demo-web-logs.png?classes=border)

You will see that there is a `main.py` file located within.

### Recap:

This walkthrough was a refresher on the following:
- Cloning a Repository
  - `git clone https://github.com/git-repo-url`

In the upcoming `branching` walkthrough we will be creating a new branch inside of this project directory and fixing a bug located within the main.py file of our `py-demo-web-logs`.
