## Git

## Git Review

Version Control Software created by Linux Torvalds

Similar to the Linux Kernel (also created by Torvalds) it is open source software
___

## Basic Workflow

Adding changes to staging

Committing changes to local git repo

Pushing changes from local repo to remote

___

### Creating a Local Repo

git init (within project directory) will initialize a git repository in your current directory

This allows you to begin controlling "versions" of your project

---

## Branches

Branches allow you to diverge from your master or main branch of development

You are able to create a new branch in multiple ways:

git branch new-branch-name

git checkout -b new-branch-name

---

## Merging

This course will cover two different types of merging strategies

Traditional merge with git merge

merging with git rebase

___

### Traditional Merge

Using the traditional merge strategy allows you to keep the original history of commits in-tact

It also means that you will be working directly on your main or master branch of development

___

### Git Rebase

git rebase will reapply commits from your current branch on top of the target branch

You are working with a feature branch and conflits are handled prior to merging directly into your main or master branch of development

A rebase does alter the history of the feature branch
