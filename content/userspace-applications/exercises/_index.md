<!-- TODO: This needs some work. I left the file in it's unedited state I got it to several weeks ago. However, it will need to change in many ways. We should provide 5-6 different files they can download with wget. Largely CSV, or just plain TXT files. THey will then need to use grep, sed and vim to search, transform, and edit files. They will also need to send an email of the transformed files to their personal email addresses.

For curl exercises we can stand up the todo-api (or provide it to them to run) and they can start crafting various GET, POST, PUT, PATCH requests at the server to get it into a specific state, then make a GET request and pipe the contents into a file, then transform the file with sed (or vim), then email the file to themselves (their TODO list)

## Exercises

Today we have a collection of mini-exercises to get our feet wet with many of the userspace applications that come standard in many Linux distributions.

## get this junk file and find the 5 lines with prices and vendors on it

- wget
- cat filename | grep "$*.*"

### create a new file with just those prices

### put all of it in a script and execute it at once

### create a remote repo for this work and then push your script to it

## clone this repo and run the python3 script
