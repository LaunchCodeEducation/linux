## Next Steps

### Ubuntu / Debian

We have barely scratched the surface on package managers. We focused on using `apt` which is a relatively recent wrapper over the older `apt-get` package manager.

Links about the Ubuntu/Debian ecosystem of package managers:

- [Ubuntu Package Search](https://packages.ubuntu.com/)
- The underlying [apt-get Package Manager Man Page](https://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get)
- The even further underlying Debian [dpgk Package Manager Man Page](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html)

### RedHat

In addition to Debian based distros RedHat based distros are also very popular.

A great place to start with learning about RedHat package managers would be to start learning about the [dnf Package Manager](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/dnf.8.html).
