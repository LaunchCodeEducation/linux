In this class we will be learning about Linux. In order to use Linux we will need to install Linux on to our computers.

In lieu of overwriting our preferred operating systems we will be using VirtualBox to create a virtual operating system **inside** of our host operating system. This is possible by partitioning a portion of our hard drive to hold a full-fledged operating system, a concept known as *virtualization*.

Using our virtual operating system we will be able to learn about and use Linux without installing it as the primary operating system of our personal computer. We will also be able to remove this virtual operating system after this class is over.

In order to setup this virtual operating system we will need to:

- Install and configure the Oracle VirtualBox software.
- Download the Ubuntu Operating System Disk Image
- Create a new virtual machine in VirtualBox.
- Configure the new virtual machine to use the Ubuntu Operating System Disk Image.
- Start our new Ubuntu virtual machine and complete the first time Ubuntu setup.

All of these steps are covered in the following articles.

Throughout this course there will be many images of the virtual machine we are configuring. The following articles will give you specific instructions for naming your virtual machine and user. The pictures from this program assume you have followed these naming conventions. If you choose to name your virtual box, or user something other than what the articles dictate your virtual operating system will still work, but your output will look slightly different than the images in this course.
