Regardless of your host OS we will all be using a similar file `ubuntu-20.04.3-desktop-*.iso`. An `.iso` file is a Disk Image which is the instruction for installing an Operating System. We will be using this file inside of Virtualbox to create an isolated Ubuntu 20.04.3 virtual operating system inside of our host computer.
