## Windows - Installation

### Run the .exe file

An executable file is a file with a predetermined set of instructions that our operating system will execute once we click it.

Double click the `.exe` file that we downloaded from the first step in this article. If you are having trouble locating the file it is more than likely located in your downloads folder. 

This will start the installation process for VirtualBox and open up the installation wizard.

#### File Location and Structure

For `File Location` we will be using the **default settings**.

Double check that your settings look similar to the image below. These are the **default settings** for the setup wizard and you should not change them.

After confirming, click the `Next` button.

#### Optional Settings

The next portion of the wizard will provide options for your installation including the following

If you feel strongly about not including a start menu, shortcut, quick launch shortcut, or registering file associations feel free to unselect the appropriate box. However all of the articles in this course assume you left the options with their default values.

{{% notice green "Bonus" "rocket" %}}
After clicking the `Install` button you should receive a windows notification bringing up a separate User Account Control window. This will ask you to allow VirtualBox to make changes to your device. We need to select `yes` or the install will fail.

{{% notice note %}}
The "Windows Security" window contains an option to "Always trust software from "Oracle Corporation". It is your decision whether or not you would like to leave it selected or unselect that option. This will not affect your installation process. For the purposes of this article we left the checkbox selected.
