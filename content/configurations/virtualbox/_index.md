## VirtualBox

This configuration will walk you through the steps of downloading and installing [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

VirtualBox is a *virtualization* tool. It will allow you to create a virtual operating system inside of your host operating system. Using this tool we will be able to begin working with a Linux Operating System inside of your personal operating system without compromising the integrity of your current Operating System. VirtualBox will handle all the implementation details and will create a isolated sandbox environment with the guest Linux Operating System.

## Downloading

First up we need to download the VirtualBox software onto our host machine.

At the time of writing VirtualBox 6.1 is the Oracle recommended version, however we recommend using the currently recommended version when you are downloading VirtualBox. See the following picture as an example.
