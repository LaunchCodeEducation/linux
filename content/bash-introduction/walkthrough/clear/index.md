## `clear` command

Our next command also takes no arguments. `clear` will clear the terminal emulator of all text.

Enter `clear` into your terminal.

![clear before execution](pictures/clear-before-execution.png?classes=border)

Then submit the command with enter.

![clear output](pictures/clear.png?classes=border)

All that text is gone! We now have a clean slate to continue working.

Most future images in this course will `clear` the screen before running new commands.
