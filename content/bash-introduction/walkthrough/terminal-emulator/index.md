## Terminal Emulator

To use this text-based Bash shell on our Ubuntu machines we will need to open a **terminal emulator** application. The terminal emulator is the graphical software that provides many features including: 
- a window
- a window exit button
- minimize and maximize window buttons

The terminal emulator is also configured to:
- handle key-press events
- handle click events
- receive Bash commands 
- display Bash Standard Output (STDOUT)

The **terminal emulator** we will be using in this class is simply called **terminal**. You can find it by clicking the *Activities* button in the top left corner of your Ubuntu screen.

Then search for the program `terminal`.

Either hit enter, or click the `terminal` application and a new `terminal emulator` will be launched!

You can also open a new terminal in Ubuntu with the `ctrl` + `alt` + `t` keyboard shortcut!
