## Bash Command Basics

This Bash shell is expecting text based commands. However, we must follow the rules for inputting the commands.

All Bash commands follow this basic pattern: `command-name --option(s) argument(s)`.

{{% notice note %}}
The previous command is non-executable and serves  only as an example of command structure.
{{% /notice %}}

Most commands have at least one argument, however they can have no arguments, provide default arguments, or sometimes allow for multiple arguments.

Bash command options are similar with regards to Bash command arguments. You won't always need an option, however they provide you with options for changing how the command will be executed, or how the output will be displayed. You may use no options, one options, or many options.
