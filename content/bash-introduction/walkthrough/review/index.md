## Review

We covered a lot of ground in this walkthrough. Look over the following list of terms used throughout this article:
- Shell
- Terminal Emulator
- Bash Shell
- Bash Commands
  - argument(s)
  - option(s)
  - `pwd`
  - `clear`
  - `ls`
  - `echo`
  - `which`
- Shell Variables
  - `$BASH`
  - `$HOME`
  - `$PATH`
  - `$BASHPID`
- Manual Pages
  - `man filename`
- `--help`
  - `command --help`

In a future lesson we will learn even more about the Bash Shell in the form of file-system navigation, and file/directory creation, editing, and deleting.
