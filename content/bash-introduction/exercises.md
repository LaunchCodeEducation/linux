## Exercises

The more practice you get with the tools in this class, the more comfortable, and faster with them you will become.

We haven't learned how to use many tools yet, but we can still practice what we have learned. We want you to walk away from this chapter with a basic understanding of the terms presented and to be comfortable with Bash command structure, and the commands presented in the Walkthrough.

### Practice

- write down the absolute path for each of the following commands:
  - `bash`
  - `which`
  - `echo`
  - `ls`
  - `users`
  - `cat`
  - `less`
  - `man`
  - `kill`
- use the **man pages** to read the DESCRIPTION of each of the previous commands
