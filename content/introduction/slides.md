## Operating System

An operating system contains two major components a **kernel** and a collection of **user space applications**.

___

## End User

Any person using a computer is considered an end user. 

An end user uses a computer to achieve some goal which varies depending on their specific needs and wants.

___

## OS Serves the End User

The OS is responsible for allowing the end user to interface with a computer by handling two responsibilities:
- managing the physical components of the computer (kernel)
- providing interfaces to the computer that can be used by the end user (user space applications)

End users **only** interact with end user applications.

---

## User Space Applications

User space applications are all of the programs on a computer that the end user interacts with directly.

Every action you have ever completed on a computer is considered an user space application. 

Creating a word document, Writing/Compiling/Executing code, watching movies, editing photos, browsing the internet, sending emails all are user space applications.

Even the Graphical User Interface (GUI) you use to select your documents and applications is itself a user space application!

___

## OS Provides the User Interface

These applications have been created with people in mind to achieve a specific goal. In essence one of the primary responsibilities of an OS is to provide a collection of programs that allow interfacing with a computer easy and intuitive.

However, under the hood the OS is also responsible for providing to a monitor, managing the mouse location, determining mouse and keyboard click events, opening programs by allocating memory (RAM), writing to disk when files are created or modified, managing CPU access to all running processes. 

All of these under the hood actions are responsibilities of the kernel.

---

## Kernel

Software that manages computer operations including all of the physical hardware of a machine.

___

## Example

Consider all the actions needed to open a word document.

From a user perspective we simply double click the file in our file manager or on our desktop.

The computer has to determine which file was clicked on based on the mouse position, find that file from hard disk storage, open the contents of the file in memory (RAM), create and send the display of the file to the monitor.

All of these under the hood tasks would burden the user and are therefore handled by the kernel.
